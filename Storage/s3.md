* Take seconds up to a couple minutes
* Must enable versioning to ensure multiple-write notifications

## CloudWatch Events

* Need to enable CloudTrail logs for S3 actions on object-level calls

## Performance

* Will scale to high request rate, 100-200ms
* 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE AND 5500 GET/HEAD req per second per prefix in a bucket
* No limit on prefixes
* Need to shard across prefixes for maximum performance

* **Multi-part upload** for files over 5GB, recommended for files for 100MB
  * Speeds up uploads by doing in parallel
* **S3 Transfer Acceleration** (upload only)
  * Increase uploads, can be combined with multi-part upload

* **S3 Byte-Range Fetches**
  * Parallelize GETs
  * Speed up downloads
  * Can resume sections
  * Only retrieve first part of files

* **S3/Glacier Select**
  * Retrieve data using SQL by performing server side filtering
  * less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side
