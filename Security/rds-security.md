* KMS encryption at rest for EBS snapshots
* Transparent Data Encryption with Oracle SQL server
* SSL encryption to RDS is possible for all DBs (in flight)
* IAM auth for MySQL Postgres, auth still happens in RDS
* Can copy un-encrypted RDS snapshot to encrypted one
* CloudTrail not used to track queries in RDS
