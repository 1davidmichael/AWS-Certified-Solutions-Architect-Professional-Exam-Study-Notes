# Opsworks

* Chef and puppet are open source tools used to configure servers automatically
* If you already have Chef/Puppet Opsworks is a good fit
* Alternative to AWS SSM
* If you see Recipes, Cookbooks or Manifests use this

## Architecture

* Stacks are composed of multiple opsworks layers
* Not managed via ASGs, but by Opsworks its self
