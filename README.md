# AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Notes

These are notes from my studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exam. Most of these are based off my studying of the Udemy AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional course and other various online sources.

There is no specific data from the actual exam, all of these were taken prior to me passing the exam. My final score was 956/1000.

I also have 5+ years experience with AWS on the job. So many of these services I use daily.
